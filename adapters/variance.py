"""
Reference agent · variance-based precision.

A simple heuristic: trust dimensions where the corrupted query has
large absolute value; down-weight dimensions that look masked (close
to zero) or noisy. Useful as a sanity-check reference — easy to beat
with a better design, hard to do worse than.

This is a SIMPLE EXAMPLE for participants to study. It is not the
intended submission template.
