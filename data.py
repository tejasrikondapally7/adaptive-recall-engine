"""
Clustered synthetic patterns and query corruption for the adaptive recall bench.

Random unit-norm patterns in N-dim are near-orthogonal — too well-
separated for cosine classification to fail, which defeats the purpose
of a precision-controlled-dynamics benchmark.

This module generates **clustered patterns** instead: K patterns spread
across C clusters, where within-cluster patterns share a common
direction (cosine ≈ intra_sim). This mirrors MNIST's class structure
and creates real ambiguity under corruption — cosine classification of
the corrupted query is no longer trivial, and the precision-controlled
dynamics must do actual recovery work.

Corruption is per-dimension mask plus a low-magnitude Gaussian, tuned
so direct cosine classification on the corrupted query is well below
the achievable retrieval ceiling.
